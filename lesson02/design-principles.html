                    <p>The Breitling website does a great job of utilizing the rule of thirds. If you follow along the 
                       top horizontal line, you're met with an array of their newest watches. From there, your eyes follow
                       straight down to where they list links for promotions and other information along the second horizontal
                       line.

                    <p>Apple pioneered the use of white space for attracting attention to their products- their whole image reflects it. 
                        Apple is the champion of minimalism and they use clean lines and white accents to carry that out. Their products, their
                        packagings, even their stores don a white, clean look. In UX, this helps the customer to focus on nothing but their product.

                    <p>I just discovered this website while I was doing this assignment, but I think it's one of my new favorite websites.
                        It perfectly embodies Hick's Law. The website presents you with one option, right in the center of your screen.
                        If you wish to look at other options, all you have to do is scroll up or down. This will animate the screen, changing
                        the background color and offering you a new idea. You can then click on that idea and scroll down, reading all about
                        the idea that you've chosen. It makes it very easy to make a decision, because there is only one possible decision on 
                        your screen at a time!
